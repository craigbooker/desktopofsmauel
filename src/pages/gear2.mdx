# Gear

#### Laptop: _Macbooo Pro 13" (late-2017)_

Latest generation of Macbook Pro with touch bar is not the best MacBook I have ever used. It came with more powerful processing power and barely useful touch bar. Yet, the experience  Still have lags on 4K videos on YouTube, graphic driver was not compatible to use Adobe Illustrator for months. Touchbar is barely useful to everyday work. I would have higher expectation to Appleâ€™s product.

#### Tablet: _iPad Mini 2019 256GB with LTE_

 I was excited the moment when i heard the rumors of new iPad mini. It was one of my fastest and not Rainer purchase decision ever. Goodbye to my iPad Mini 2 (which is a valuable gift from my internship) but it is too slow for any kind of serious work that I only use it for media consumption and book reading. With Apples generous offer to the latest mobile power to a previously entry-tier tablet model, it is definitely worth to try it as a daily driver. Review is coming soon.
