            <p> Hello! My name is Samuel. I'm a product designer who visions design as a mean to cross the barriers between sectors, by making technology more accessible. I craft wireframes and prototypes and execute stunning visuals and user interfaces.</p>
            <p>I started my agency <a ref="www.playa.hk">Playa</a> in 2015, hoping to help small entrepreneurs and non-profits launching their projects, bridging the gap between project owners and end-users. </p>
            <p>I launched <a href="https://pin.desktopofsamuel.com" target="blank">Pin</a> in 2018 to collect essential design tools to help designer to step up their game.</p>
            <p>I am constantly learning and treasure every opportunity to design better. Iâ€™m learning to code right now and this personal site site is my first attempt.</p>
