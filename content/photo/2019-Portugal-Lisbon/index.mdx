Spent days in Lisbon capturing tramway. Single-deck tram is clearly more versatile than the double-deck one in Hong Kong, as they climb through the hills of Lisbon.

One of the hidden gems we visited was [Carris Museum](http://museu.carris.pt/en/) (Museu da Carris), located at the tram depot in Alcantara. The depot is still in use, while part of it has become exhibtion areas. In between exhibit halls, you have take a tram ride of a classic tram inside the depot. And we were the only visitors at the time.
