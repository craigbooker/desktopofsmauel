Spent days in Lisbon capturing tramway. The earthquake in 1755 almost destroyed the city, but it also gave the European port a clean slate for modern city design. As trams climb through the hills of Lisbon, passing through streets and places other public transport do not reached. It has become a unique city landscape.

One of the hidden gems we visited was [Carris Museum](http://museu.carris.pt/en/) (Museu da Carris), located at the tram depot in Alcantara. The depot is still in use, while part of it has become exhibtion areas. In between exhibit halls, you have take a tram ride of a classic tram inside the depot. And we were the only visitors at the time.
