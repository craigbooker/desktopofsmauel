Where two continents collide, Istanbul is a beautiful city that exemplifies both tradition and modernity. Walking along the tramway from Taksim Square to Ataturk Bridge, you can see a vibrant city life. Yet, the unique architecture of mosques and fajr prayers every morning constantly remind us that we are visiting a country with vastly different culture.

One of my favorite visits is the [Museum of Innoncence](http://en.masumiyetmuzesi.org/), created by the Nobel-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk. He collected and meticulously arranged ‘real’ objects as companion to his touching love story. 

> “In poetically well built museums, formed from the heart's compulsions, we are consoled not by finding in them old objects that we love, but by losing all sense of time.” - Orhan Pamuk
