Organised by Watershed Hong Kong, Living Monument is a memorial event that took place in 2016 Dec to commemorate the Battle of Hong Kong during the Second World War. Actors dressed up as soldiers of Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps and they distributed informative cards to the public about this important period in the history of Hong Kong. I worked as a voluntary photographer for this event.
