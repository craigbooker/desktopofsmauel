Playa has taken the job for revamping the app and content management system. I have participated in the project as project manager and product designer in 2017. Primary objective of the project is to expand on the water dispenser database with more metadata, e.g. opening hours, photos and water temperature. New dispenser page also include Google Map integration and suggest feature on revising the database.

Since the revamp app launch in 2017 July. More than 30,000 downloads have been achieved across iOS and Android. It was also featured on the App Store repeatedly in “New Apps We Like” during launch, later in “World Water Day”, “Pedal-powered fun” and "Make Your Life Greener" collections.
