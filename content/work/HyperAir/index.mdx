### Introduction

In 2018, Playa has worked with HyperAir to ship a prototype that embellish the experience of foreign currency exchange in Hong Kong. I have worked as a full-time product designer at HyperAir starting 2019. As a product designer, aside from crafting wireframes, user interfaces and prototypes, weighing in  business goals as well as daily operation through out my design process is a main part of my job.

### Brand Style and Language

Appealing to frequent travellers and young people, we have concluded the brand style to be bold and casual. [Neon color palettes](https://zeroheight.com/055c0944d/p/68b40e) are adopted for primary buttons and header background. We bring in Cantonese (Mother tongue in Hong Kong) instead of Chinese in our UI copy to be more friendly and approachable. 

While we are developing more service modules, it is important for users to remember us as an integrating travel platform. In the early stage of building a well-known travel brand, our logo is showcased extensively in app design, as well as third-party promotions.

Extravagant photos taken all around the world were also displayed, in order to create an immersive experience to connect our app with travel. 

### Currency Exchange

> Currency exchange in Hong Kong is not transparent enough for customers to compare exchange rate and service  

This is the mission statement of the initial app launch in 2018 Fall. Adopting a B2C model to bridge the gap between FX stores and travellers, the app aims to become travellers’ essential. Before departure, exchange quotes from client app will be sent to partnered FX stores, so user may compare up-to-date exchange prices and reserve online. 

One of the problems we encountered designing for currency exchange is data. We attempted to clear up and display only necessary information, however feedbacks were out of our expectations by keeping a minimal layout was wrong. Users prefer to display more data at once when they deal with money, rather than separating in tabs and corners. We have quickly adjusted the design to fit more content within the same page, and adopts design hierarchy to stress on important data.

### All-round Travel Service

As the app continues to grow, We have launched more features to facilitate the course of a traveller in preparing their trips.

- **Travel SIM** - Data SIM marketplace to get you connected while you travel. It is also first online eSIM store in Hong Kong
- **Travel Insurance** - Compare price and coverage for your travel insurance plans
- **Travel Inspiration** - Read handpicked travel articles about popular destinations to increase brand loyalty and app usage
- **Travel Experience** - Book local experience and tours with our partner network


### Challenges & Solutions

As the first and only designer in the company, I worked closely with two co-founders who lead business and product development, together with two software engineers to ship our app. Transitioning from an agency to a startup, we adopted agile workflow instead of waterfall to deliver and improve continuously. 

The biggest challenges we encountered is the limitation on resources and time, we have to prioritise features, enhancement and bug fix through a two-week sprint.  

In design aspect, we ideate quickly by sketching required flows and designing on possible user interfaces one sprint ahead.  We also collect feedbacks from our customers and analytical data to improve sales funnels after shipping our updates. 

From design operation perspective, creating our design token and projects files ready for scaling is also essential. I also will write an article on this topic.

### Takeaway

Strike the balance between users need and business goals is a challenging tasks as a product designer. More factors have taken in consideration, like business operation, competitors, technical and design debt etc. 

Design is making conscious choices that people perceive visually. Reflecting on what I can do better, I believe it’s the documentation of the design process. As we were redesigning some old pages, I realised documenting all decisions and start building a “knowledge base” is essential to contribute a team and also a product’s growth.
